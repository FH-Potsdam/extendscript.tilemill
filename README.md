# extendscript.tilemill

InDesign CS5+
export png images from tilemill and import them to InDesign.  

still w.i.p.  

## prerequisites  

Learn a bit of tile mill. A got starter is this tutorial.  

## Getting Started
Download the [production version](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/extendscript.tilemill) from the folder dist.

- Export a PNG file from TileMill and save the used bounding box.  
- You can set some settings in the script.  

See these settings in the top of the script:  

    var DEBUG = true; // lots of output to the JS Console of ESTK
    var settings = {
      new_doc:true, // you can work in a existing doc. make sure you have the right bounding box
     new_layers: true, // use new layers for markers and text
      new_marker_layer_name: 'marker', // layer name
      new_text_layer_name: 'text', // layer name
      latitude_key:"", // just leave it alone the scripts looks for it by itself
      longitude_key:"",// just leave it alone the scripts looks for it by itself
      text_key:"",// just leave it alone the scripts looks for it by itself
      use_textframe:true, // set to true to create a text marker
      use_marker:true, // set to true to create a basic marker or use the selection
      // leave them alone if your csv uses one of these names 
      // the script analyses the data and tries to guess the lat lon fields by these naems
      possible_lat_keys : ["latitude","Latitude","LATITUDE","lat", "Lat","LAT"],
      possible_lon_keys : ["longitude","Longitude","LONGITUDE","lon", "Lon","LON"],
      /**
       * The following setting allows you to offset the marker
       * orientation possibilites are:
       * DEFAULT
       * CENTER
       * TOP
       * BOTTOM
       * LEFT
       * RIGHT
       * UPPER_LEFT
       * LOWER_LEFT
       * UPPER_RIGHT
       * LOWER_RIGHT
       */
      default_marker_orientation: "CENTER"
      };

- run the script from the InDesign Scripts Panel.

![](docs/assets/images/img-select.png)  

- select your image (optional: if you have `new_doc:true` set to true)

![](docs/assets/images/csv-select.png)  

- then select your csv file

![](docs/assets/images/dialog.png)  

- the dialog comes up  
- enter the minimum maximum lat lon values from tilemill. 

![](docs/assets/images/img_-120_-45_120_45.png)  

- -120,-45,120,45 is ordered like this [min lon, min lat, max lon, max lat]
- if you use text markers. Select from the dropdown the field you want to enter.  
- see the magic happen.

Big thanks to @sebastian-meier for the awesome image geo location mapping.  

## Possible Problems  

When creating markers the script places all data within your csv. That means also data that lies outside of the page is placed. This could produce a problem for InDesign. page items that are outside of the pasteboard can make InDesign documents unusable.  

The best solution for this problem is to use the script "CleanupPasteboard.js" by [indiscirpts](http://www.indiscripts.com/post/2009/09/clean-up-your-pasteboard). It removes all objects outside of the page. If you use a the bleed or slug option everything works fine. If you wan't to define a custom value make sure to first set your document to use mm again. The settings of the doc are set to pixels. This causes an error for the script.
